            My name is Eric Boyle, I was born and raised in the city of Oshawa. I just moved to Ottawa at the beginning of September, and thoroughly enjoy living here! I am currently 20 years old and will be celebrating my 21<sup>st</sup> birthday in November. I think that <em>life</em> shouldn't be all about school and work, so when I have free time, I spend it reading, writing and going to the gym, because this allows me to have balance in my <em>life</em>.

            In terms of school, I graduated high school in 2020 and I still didn't know what I want to do as a profession, so I decided to play it safe and took a business fundamental at <abbr title="Durham College">DC</abbr>. I thoroughly enjoyed learning the different aspects of business and I had plans to go into the marketing stream for my 2<sup>nd</sup> year, but I realized I still didn't know what I want to do as a profession, so I ended up coming to Algonquin College in 2021 instead. I ended up taking a one-year design foundation, and I was mesmerized by the campus and environment, that last year after I graduated I started looking into other design study programs that Algonquin College offered, which is how I ended up finding <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>.
